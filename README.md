# Overview of Repository
- [Fig1](Fig1): Scripts to replicate Fig 1 in paper, i.e. train VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 with varying amounts of variance and bias in gradient estimates.

- [Student-Teacher](Student-Teacher): Scripts to replicate Fig 3-6 in paper, i.e. student-teacher setup experiments for both feedforward MLP and VGG-xx networks. 

- [Generalization](Generalization): Scripts to replicate Fig 7 in paper, i.e. verifying claims about generalization performance.
